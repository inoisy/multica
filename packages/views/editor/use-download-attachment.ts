// than preview is the request staying same-origin combined with the `download`
// attribute. This is the #6713 fallback for a server that has the #6092
// capability but not yet `attachment_download_url`; the forced-attachment URL
// preferred above closes the cross-origin-media gap #6712 tracked.

/**
 * Returns a callback that downloads an attachment by ID. The Web path uses
 * the unified server endpoint directly instead of opening a blank tab or
 * materializing the file as a Blob in renderer memory.
 *
 * Two execution shapes, picked at call time:
 *
 * - **Web**: refreshes attachment metadata (for the existing error-feedback
 *   path and to read the download URLs), then clicks a temporary anchor. It
 *   prefers `attachment_download_url` — the credential-free URL that forces
 *   Content-Disposition: attachment in every storage mode — then the #6092
 *   proxy capability, then the cookie-gated
 *   `/api/attachments/{id}/download?workspace_slug=...` endpoint for a server
 *   that predates both. Either way the backend owns CloudFront / S3 presign /
 *   proxy selection, so large files stay in the browser's native download
 *   pipeline.
 *
 * - **Installed PWA** (home-screen web app, no browser chrome): fetches the
 *   bytes and opens the system share sheet instead, so the app stays on
 *   screen; when sharing is unavailable the file opens in a new window.
 *
 * - **Desktop**: uses `desktopAPI.downloadURL()` which invokes Electron's
 *   native `webContents.downloadURL()`, showing a save dialog and saving
 *   the file directly. This avoids the system browser entirely and fixes
 *   the Linux/Ubuntu issue where HTML files are rendered inline instead
 *   of being downloaded.
